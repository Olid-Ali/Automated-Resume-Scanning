The **Automated Resume Screening** app uses Python and machine learning to automate the process of screening resumes for job applications. The model analyzes resumes and ranks them based on their relevance to a job description, helping recruiters streamline their hiring process.

## Features
- **Resume Analysis**: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract key information from resumes.
- **Job Matching**: Compares resume content with job descriptions to rank resumes.
- **Machine Learning**: A trained model that improves its prediction over time with more data.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: For building the app and implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, TfidfVectorizer for NLP.
